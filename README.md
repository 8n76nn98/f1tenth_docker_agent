# F1TENTH Competition Docker Agent Template

This repo contains a standardized template for creating your own Docker containerized agent submission to F1TENTH competitions.

## Overview
This repo serves as a guide to get participants started on creating their own agent submissions to the F1TENTH competitions.

The overall structure of a race is shown in the diagram below. The racing agents will be fully contained in their own docker containers as well as the simulation environment. A ROS bridge is created so that participants could use the ROS interface to receive sensor information and publish drive messages.
